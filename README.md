## How to use the bot

You can use the bot going [here](https://t.me/StickerifyImageBot): start it, and you can now send it the medias you need
to convert.

Based on what you send, [Stickerify](https://t.me/StickerifyImageBot) will answer the following:

* the converted media, if you sent a supported file (images, gifs, videos, and existing Telegram stickers are supported)
  that needed conversion
* no file, if you sent a media already suiting Telegram's requirements
* an error message, if you sent an unsupported file
* an informative message for any message without a file

## How to create a new sticker

1. Chat with [Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers), and use it to create a sticker pack
2. Ask [Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers) to add a new sticker
3. Use [Stickerify](https://t.me/StickerifyImageBot) to create the proper file for your sticker
4. Forward [Stickerify](https://t.me/StickerifyImageBot)'s message to [Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers)
5. Choose an emoji representing your sticker

And it's done!

## How to set up the project

1. Install JDK 21 (or higher)
2. Clone the project and move into its folder
3. Run the command `./gradlew build -x test`
4. Import the project inside your IDE as a Gradle project
5. Ensure your IDE is correctly configured to use a Java 21 (or higher) JDK

## How to run the bot locally

After you successfully set up the project, you will have to go through the following steps:

1. Chat with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and ask it to create a new bot
2. Copy the token it provided you and either:
    * set it as the value of a new environment variable named `STICKERIFY_TOKEN`
    * use it as the value passed to the `super(botToken)` constructor inside `Stickerify`
3. Install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
4. Run the `Main` class to start the bot, it will be now able to answer messages in Telegram

## How to launch the bot using Docker

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Prepare the Docker image either:
    * building it with the command:
       ```shell
       docker build -t rob93c/stickerify .
       ```
    * pulling the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/):
       ```shell
       docker pull rob93c/stickerify
       ```
3. Now you just need to run the Docker image passing the token (`{{TOKEN}}`) retrieved
   from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather):
   ```shell
   docker run -e "STICKERIFY_TOKEN={{TOKEN}}" rob93c/stickerify
   ```
